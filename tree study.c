number of leaf nodes =NUmber of Internal Nodes +1(FUll BinarY TRee)

binary tree all levels's nodes   have  left and right child except the last level which has the left nodes.

tHe Perfect BINARY TREE has all internal nodes with left, right child and all leaves are at same level.

AVL tree maintain O(logn) height by making difference of 1 between height of left and right subtree.

REd-BlACK tree maintain height O(logn) by making sure that number of black nodes from root to leaf node are same and there are no adjacent red nodes.

A degenerate tree is one having every internal node one child there performance is like linked list.

Rooted binary tree is a tree with a root node in which every node has at most two children

Perfect BT/A full binary tree/Proper BT/strictly BT is a tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children
